# What is ZIKIZA?

<img width="1000" alt="Goals" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26790710/228222572-7ca7d558-f39a-45c0-a3a2-6eade01174b6.png">

## Motivation

- We are living in an increasingly polluted environment. The fact that the flowering season is a month earlier in spring indicates a lot to us. 
- If the Earth does not become healthier, there will be no place for people to stay. That's why we have decided to provide solutions to protect the environment and address climate change.
- We believed that individual efforts alone would have limited impact on environmental action. Moreover, we thought that without reasonable conditions, personal commitments to environmental protection would gradually weaken over time.

- ZIKIZA(ÏßÄÌÇ§Ïûê) phrase in Korean has two meanings:
  - ***Protect** the earth by practicing challenges related to the environment as individuals.*
  - ***Complete** the challenge that we have participated in.*

## Server

> *figure 1: This illustrates the relational diagram of the our database.*

### 2. Google Firebase

> *figure 2: [Using firebase cloud messaging in Springboot applications](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-fcm)*

- We used Firebase for authentication / authorization handling.
- Firebase to easily perform the Google sign in process.

> *figure 3: [Create a private key in the Firebase project service account](https://firework-ham.tistory.com/111)*

- It can be easily developed in a short development period, and login processing is easy on the web and app, so I used it.
- In addition, in order to save it to DB, you can receive the user's IDToken when you respond to the api, analyze it through the Firebase key, and save it.

### 3. Google Geocoding

<img width="550" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26790710/227831391-5db82a45-337c-4f4d-880b-0cf5f4a8b8cb.png" />

> *figure 4: [Geocoding API process](https://firework-ham.tistory.com/111)*

- This allows recycling stores or community locations to be stored as latitude and longitude and displayed as Google Map markers.
- Utilizing a structure that returns latitude and longitude when given an address input.
- Save the corresponding data to the project database to create a Google Maps marker.


### 4. Google Cloud Storage

<img width="350" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26790710/227833036-8f341d20-46ee-4eb8-b14c-3a540e6beabf.png" />

> *figure 5: [Google Cloud Storage bucket structure](https://firework-ham.tistory.com/111)*

- To successfully store challenge verification photos on the server, we use Google Cloud Storage.
- Google Cloud Storage is a service that stores objects in Google Cloud. At this point, the object refers to any form of file and stores the object in a container called a bucket.

> *figure 6: [Create a bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/discover-object-storage-console)*
- All buckets are connected to a project and can also be set up to allow the desired user to access the data in storage through project permissions.



## Getting Started

| tool | version |
| :---: | :------: |
| mysql | 8.0.31 |
| java | 11.0.16 |
| springframework.boot | 2.7.8 |

1. After installing Mysql, create a database called 'solution_challenge'.
2. After generating the Firebase key, Google Geocode api key, and Google cloud storage IAM key, save it.
3. Run the "./gradlew build" command
4. Google cloud storage's IAM key is stored in a global variable called GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS.
  ```shell
    # Example Code
    $ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="KEY_PATH"
  ```
5. Insert the received key into the jar command. It also contains the database password.
``` shell
nohup java -Dspring.datasource.password=[DBPASSWORD] -Dspring.google.api=[google Geocode api] -Dspring.firebase.key=[FIREBASEKEY] -jar [PROJECT NAME] 2>&1 &
```

  ``` yml
  server:
    port: 8443
    ssl:
